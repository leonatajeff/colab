        We are a team of students disillusioned by the lectures of
        entrepreneurship on campus — we believe learning is best done by doing.
        We are making a bet on student potential — student builders have created
        this generation's most impactful products like Facebook, Dropbox,
        Reddit, and DoorDash. We are super bullish on what Pitt's talent can
        achieve. We’re talking about initiatives like Pitt's very own national
        startup career fair to help you land internships, software products with
        recurring revenue, and networking events to accelerate your college
        career.
