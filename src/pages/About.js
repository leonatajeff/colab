//We’re talking about initiatives like a startup fair at University of Pittsburgh, software products with recurring revenue, and networking events to accelerate your college career.

// We are making a bet on student potential — student builders have created this generation's most impactful products like Facebook, Dropbox, Reddit, and DoorDash. We are super bullish on what Pitt's talent can achieve.
